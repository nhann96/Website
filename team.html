		<p class="text-left">Hey, SOSY friends! I’m Josh. It’s nice to meet you!
								I am honoured and privileged to be leading and serving the Software Systems Student Society because of the events 
								I host and the connections I make with other SOSY friends like you! Whether you are competing in hackathons, playing 
								dodgeball at frosh, or taking advantage of the free pizza and pop at Board Games Night every month, I can guarantee 
								you’ll have lots of fun because I myself have fun organizing those with the rest of the SSSS leader
								I make sure my life is not decided on the number of hours I sit near the computer everyday. I usually sing, play guitar, 
								or listen to music during my study breaks. I compete in hackathons so I can spend time coding and laughing at compile-time errors 
								with my friends. I also own a pair of Nike Roshes and Nike Frees to correct my posture while I’m coding. (Besides, they look awesome!)
								Software Systems is my program because of my interest in bioinformatics and front-end development. Other than that, I 
								love those CMPT courses where team collaboration is involved because I get to make new friends. (I’m sure you’ll do, too!)
